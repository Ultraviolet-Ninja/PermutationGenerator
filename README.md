# Permutation Generator

## Description

Project was designed to explore how permutation generation works and to collect all possible permutations of a given array.

A program like this runs in O(n!) "factorial time", making it incredibly slow and large when the array size gets above 10

While the collection part wasn't successful, this served a good lesson in understanding how to make permutations in Java, how to make it a multithreaded application and the maximum capacities of the major collections in Java besides the LinkedList and other Node based structures whereas most are capped at

```java
Integer.MAX_VALUE
```
## Future

I might come up with ways to edit the program to serve different use cases
